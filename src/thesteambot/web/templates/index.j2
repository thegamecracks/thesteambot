    <p><a href="https://github.com/thegamecracks/thesteambot">GitHub</a></p>
    <p>An experimental Discord application for fetching Steam connections from users.</p>
    <p>
        This is mostly a learning exercise for myself as I try to combine a webserver,
        OAuth2, and a Discord bot in the same project, so please don't use this in production!
